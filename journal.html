<h1> journal entry 1 </h1>
<p> this week i learned that there is no such thing as a desktop and that it's just a GUI (graphic user interface). You can actually navigate your entire computer through Terminal, which is apparently what you see in those hacker movies. It's weird to think how chaotic it would be trying to teach an older relative how to navigate a computer just through Terminal, though in a sense that could also be easier. </p>

<h1> journal entry 2 </h1>
<p> the web is essentially a bunch of connected computers that have websites. when a computer's connected to the web and is spitting out a website it's considered a server because it's serving the website. <br> everything in html has to have a start and end tag. all the code has to be within the "html" tags for it to run. it also largely relies on the head and body sections, which provide functions for the code and actual actions for it respectively. <br> overall, coding has made me feel incredbily frustrated. this is especially true when it comes to the person card and the website, as i feel we were just thrown into this right off the bat. <br> for a paragraph you use a "p" tag, for which there is no end tag just as for the break tag which is "br". for headings you use "h" tags ranging from "h1" to "h6" decreasing in size as the numbers increase. <br> in order to italicize, an "em" tag is used on either side of the text, one being an opening tag and the other being a closing tag. the "strong" tag is used to bold text, and is also located on either side of the text, one being an opening tag and the other being a closing tag. finally, if you want to bold and italicize at the same time you can put one inside of the other, wrapping the entire text with one and the specific section with both with the other tag directly around it. </p>

<h1> journal entry 3 </h1>
<p> i think my animation code works because all i'm really doing is just morphing the size of the shape. then, i change the border radius, which gives me the circle. further, it's just the same thing repeated many, many times, which boils down to one or two simple blocks of code. <br> i decided to make the animation that i did because i've always found animations that change shape really interesting. i also wanted to add a layer to this, which i did through the colors changing and the number of divs i have.<p>
